"""
This module provides functions to visualize a concept map generated from processed relationships between concepts.
It includes functionalities to create interactive graph visualizations and generate word clouds representing the concepts.

The primary functionalities include:
1. **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Converts a NetworkX graph into an interactive HTML visualization using pyvis.
   The graph can be manipulated dynamically in a web browser, allowing for physics simulations, node filtering, and clustering.
2. **Word Cloud Generation**: Creates a word cloud image from a list of concepts, visually representing the frequency
   of each concept.

Main Functions:
- `visualize_graph_interactive(G: nx.Graph, output_path: Union[Path, str]) -> None`:
    Visualizes the given graph interactively using pyvis and saves the result as an HTML file. The nodes are colored
    based on their community, and the visualization allows for interactive exploration of the graph.

- `generate_wordcloud(concept_list: List[str], output_path: str = None) -> None`:
    Generates a word cloud image from a list of concepts, optionally saving the result to a file. The word cloud
    visually represents the frequency of concepts, with more frequent concepts displayed more prominently.

Workflow:
1. **Graph Conversion**: Converts the provided NetworkX graph into a pyvis graph, applying styles and attributes
   like node size and edge width based on centrality and relationship frequency.
2. **Interactive Visualization**: Saves the interactive graph as an HTML file, which can be explored in any web browser.
3. **Word Cloud Creation**: Generates a word cloud image from the list of concepts and optionally saves it to disk.

Dependencies:
- NetworkX: For graph data structure and manipulation.
- Matplotlib: For color mapping and displaying the word cloud.
- Pyvis: For creating interactive graph visualizations in HTML.
- WordCloud: For generating word cloud images.
