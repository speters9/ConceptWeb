"""
This module provides functions for constructing and visualizing a concept map based on extracted relationships
between concepts from lesson readings and objectives.

The primary functionalities include:
1. **Building a Graph**: Construct an undirected graph from the relationships, normalizing edge weights and node centrality.
2. **Community Detection**: Detect communities within the graph using various clustering methods such as 'leiden', 'louvain', or 'spectral'.
3. **Graph Visualization**: Prepare the graph for visualization, assigning attributes like node size and community labels.

Main Functions:
- `build_graph(relationships: List[Tuple[str, str, str]]) -> nx.Graph`:
    Builds an undirected graph from processed relationships. Normalizes edge weights and node centrality,
    with handling for cases where normalization isn't possible due to lack of variation.

- `detect_communities(G: nx.Graph, method: str = "leiden", num_clusters: int = None) -> nx.Graph`:
    Detects communities within the graph using the specified method ('leiden', 'louvain', or 'spectral').
    Assigns community labels to nodes for use in visualizations.

Workflow:
1. **Process Relationships**: Takes the extracted relationships and processes them into a graph.
2. **Normalize Attributes**: Normalizes edge weights and node centrality to ensure visual clarity.
3. **Community Detection**: Identifies clusters or communities within the graph, which can help in understanding
   how concepts are grouped.
4. **Error Handling**: Provides fallback mechanisms for cases where normalization cannot be performed due to
   insufficient data variation.

Dependencies:
- NetworkX: For graph construction and basic community detection.
- CDlib: For advanced community detection algorithms like 'leiden'.
- Scikit-learn: For spectral clustering, which is an alternative method for community detection.
